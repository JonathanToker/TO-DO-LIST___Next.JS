## TO-DO-LIST_APP
A responsive Next.JS app which allows people to save their "to-do" tasks in localStorage, with the ability to remove some of them by clicking the "x", refresh everything and change theme. This is my first ever Node.js app with TypeScript, I did a few projects with JSX but this was the first time doing it with TSX. I took a little inspiration from the previous Meme Generator project I did with React & Vite which I've done during the 14 hour Scrimba.com course.

The web kit I used for this project was: Next.JS, React, TypeScript and CSS.
The main goal of this project is to practice my React skills with TypeScript & localStorage
